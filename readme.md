Visca Web Frontend Test
======


## Estructure
I've used BEM and ITCSS for the structure of the TEST. I've not used all the ITCSS layers. but this is the first step in order to have a clear architecture in the CSS part. 
For polyfills wes should install Webpack for autogenerate the CSS files and Autoprexifr for compile automatically.
 
## Resources
I've download the Source Sans Pro font in order to use the preload attribute to improve web performance. 

## Links
For have multiple links and don't have problems with nested links (nested links are nod valid), my decision was have a main link in absolute position that covers all the card, and the other links above (Read more link) with a hightest z-index. 

## Hover effects
For have multiple links and don't have problems with nested links (nested links are nod valid), my decision was have a main link in absolute position that covers all the card, and the other links above (Read more link) with a hightest z-index.
