Visca Web Frontend Test
======


## Estructure
- I've used BEM and ITCSS for the structure of the TEST. I've not used all the ITCSS layers. but this is the first step in order to have a clear architecture in the CSS part. 
- For polyfills wes should install Webpack for autogenerate the CSS files and Autoprexifr for compile automatically.
 
## Resources
- I've download the Source Sans Pro font in order to use the preload attribute to improve web performance.
- In order to be fast, I've used Font Awesome as a icon resource for the stars. In other terms, I would create a Webfont from SVGs for not import icons that I don't actually need.  

## Links
- For have multiple links and don't have problems with nested links (nested links are nod valid), my decision was have a main link in absolute position that covers all the card, and the other links above (Read more link) with a hightest z-index. 

## Hover effects
- For have multiple links and don't have problems with nested links (nested links are nod valid), my decision was have a main link in absolute position that covers all the card, and the other links above (Read more link) with a hightest z-index. 

## Other explanations
- I didn't make the menu due this wasn't an exercise part.
